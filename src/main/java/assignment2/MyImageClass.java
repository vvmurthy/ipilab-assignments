/**
 * In this assignment, you are going to be
 * creating a class to model an image,
 *  without having any actual image data
 *  in it.
 *
 *
 *  TASK 1) Class data fields
 *  Think about the differences and similarities
 *  in an image
 *  + How are we going to model the dimensions of an image?
 *  Its height is some amount, its row is some amount. How
 *  will we store that as a class variable?
 *
 *
 *  TASK 2) Constructor
 *  Write a constructor for your MyImageClass. You should
 *  have the constructor accept enough data to fill every single
 *  class data field from class 1.
 *
 *  TASK 3) Getters and setters
 *  + create functions to return specific class fields, and
 *  functions to set their values after construction of an object
 *
 *  2 Things I want you to consider:
 *  1) Can we have an image of 0 pixel height? how about negative height?
 *  negative width?
 *  2) What sort of values can we store in our image? Remember a few
 *  months ago our discussion about the unsigned integer 8 type and how
 *  images are usually represented using the values between [0, 255].
 *  How will your program make sure "set" image data is valid?
 *
 *  I am not going to check actual functionality of this program,
 *  but rather just look at your code to see if it is designed properly.

public class MyImageClass {

    // DEFINE YOUR class fields here
    // E.g. private int myInteger;

    // DEFINE YOUR constructors here
    // Remember the syntax of a constructor from 11.3

    // Define your getters and setters here
    // They will be the the format (for getters)
    // public <Datatype> getMyValue(){return myValue;}
    // where Datatype is the datatype of the class field myValue
    // (and for setters)
    // public void setMyValue(Datatype newMyValue){this.myValue = newMyValue;}
